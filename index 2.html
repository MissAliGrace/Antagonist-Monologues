    <b>CERSEI:</b> Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess: It felt good, beating me. Starving me. Frightening me. Humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows, all his septons, all his septas. All his filthy soldiers. Because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good, under the right circumstances.

        <b>LISA:</b> Help me understand, Daisy. Because, I thought you didn’t do Valium. Tell me how this safety net is working for you. Tell me that you don’t take that blade and drag it across your skin and pray for the courage to press down. Tell me… how your daddy helps you cope with that. Illuminate me. I bet… with every inch of his manhood. They didn’t release you because you got better, Daisy. They just gave up. You call this a life, hmm? Taking daddy’s money, buying your dollies and your nick-knacks, eating his fucking chicken, fattening up like a prize fucking heifer. You changed the scenery but not the fucking situation. And the warden makes house calls. And everybody knows. Everybody knows… that he fucks you. But what they don’t know… is that you like it. Hmm? You like it. But hey man, it’s cool. Whatever. A man is a dick is a man is a dick is a chicken, is a dad, a Valium, a speculum, whatever. Whatever. You like being Mrs. Randone. Probably all you’ve ever known, huh?

        <b>JOAN CRAWFORD:</b> No wire hangers! What's wire hangers doing in this closet when I told you no wire hangers?! EVER!!!! I work till I'm half dead and I hear people say she's getting old! What do I get ? A daughter who cares as much about a beautiful dress I give her as she cares about me. What's wire hangers doing in this closet?! Answer me! I buy you beautiful dresses and you treat 'em like some dishrag! You threw a 300 dollar dress on a wire hanger! We'll see how many you got hidden in here, we'll see! All of this is coming out! Out! Out! Out! Out! We're gonna see how many wire hangers you got in your closet! Wire hangers. Why? Why? Christina, get out of that bed! Get out of that bed! You live in the most beautiful house in Brentwood and you dont care about crease marks from wire hangers, and your room looks like some two dollar unfurnished room in some two- bit backstreet town in Oklahoma! Get up! Clean up this mess! Did you scrub the bathroom floor today? Did you?

        <b>O-REN ISHII:</b> As your leader, I encourage you to -- from time to time and always in a respectful manner -- to question my logic. If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so. But allow me to convince you. And I will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo ... except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fucking head. Just like this fucker here. Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!! ... I didn't think so.

        <b>NURSE RACHED:</b> Boys, I’ve given a great deal of thought to what I’m about to say. I’ve talked it over with the staff and we all came to the same conclusion – that there should be some form of punishment for the unspeakable behavior of yesterday. Most of you are here because you could not adjust to the outside world. You broke the rules of society. At some time… in your childhood perhaps… you were allowed to get away with that. But when you broke a rule you knew it. You wanted to be punished – needed it – but the punishment did not come. That leniency on the part of your parents may have been the germ of your present illness. I remind you of this, hoping you will understand that it is entirely for your own good that we enforce discipline. Is there any comment? I assume that you understand me and agree. You also understand that it is difficult to enforce discipline in these surroundings. After all, what can we do you? You can’t be arrested. You can’t be sent to an institution, you’re already there. All we can do is take away privileges.

        <b>ALEX FORREST:</b> Hello, Dan. Are you surprised? This is what you've reduced me to. I guess you thought you'd get away with it. Well... you can't. 'Cause part of you is growing inside of me, and that's a fact, Dan, and... you'd better start... learning how to deal with it. 'Cause you know, I... I feel you. I taste you. I think you. I touch you. Can you understand? Can you? I'm just... asking you... to acknowledge your responsibilities. Is that so bad? I don't think so. I-I don't think it's unreasonable. And, you know, another thing is that you thought that you could just walk into my life, and turn it upside down, without a thought for anyone but yourself. You know what you are, Dan? You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch. I hate you. I bet you don't even like girls, do you? Ha! You disappoint me, you fucking faggot!

    <b>POLLY:</b> If I come for you, and I still might yet decide to come for you, I will wear high heels so you can hear my approach on the cobblestones and have time to repent. You listen to my footsteps.

    <b>MED EA:</b> Women, my mind is clear. I go to slay 
My children with all speed, and then, away 
From hence; not wait yet longer till they stand 
Beneath another and an angrier hand 
To die. Yea, howsoe'er I shield them, die 
They must. And, seeing that they must, 'tis I 
Shall slay them, I their mother, touched of none 
Beside. Oh, up and get thine armour on, 
My heart! Why longer tarry we to win 
Our crown of dire inevitable sin? 
Take up thy sword, O poor right hand of mine, 
Thy sword: then onward to the thin-drawn line 
Where life turns agony. Let there be naught 
Of softness now: and keep thee from that thought, 
'Born of thy flesh,' 'thine own belovèd.' Now, 
For one brief day, forget thy children: thou 
Shalt weep hereafter. Though thou slay them, yet 
Sweet were they. . . . I am sore unfort unate.

    <b>AM Y DUNNE:</b> Cool   girl. Men always use that, don’t they? As their defining compliment. She’s a cool gir l. Cool girl is hot. Cool girl is game. Co ol girl is fun. Cool girl never gets angry at her man. She only smi les in a chagrin loving manner and then presents her mouth for fucking. She like what he likes. So, evidently, he’s a vinyl hipster who loves fetish monger. If he likes girls gone wild, she’s a mall babe who talks football and endu res buffalo wings at Ho oters.
    When I met Ni ck Dunne, I knew he want ed a cool girl and for him, I’ll admit, I was willing to try. I wax stripped my pussy   raw. I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandl er movies. I ate cold pizza and remained a size 2. I blew him… semi regul arly. I lived in the moment. I was fucking g ame. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it… Nick teased out in my things I didn’t know existed. A li ghtness, a humour, an ease. 
    But I made him sma rter, sharper, I inspired him to rise to my level. I forged the man of my dream s. We were happy pret ending to be other people. We were the happi est people we knew. And what’s the point  of being together if you’re not the hap piest. But Nick got lazy. He became so meone I did not agree to marry. He act ua lly expected me to love him unco nditionally then he dragged me, penniless, to the naval of this great country and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier cool girl.
    You thi nk I’d let him des troy me and end up happi er than ever? No fuck ing way. He doesn’t get to win. My cute, charmi ng, salt of the earth misery guy. He needed to learn. Grown ups work for things. Grown ups pay. Grown ups suffer consequences.

    <b>CERSEI:</b> Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess: It felt good, beating me. Starving me. Frightening me. Humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows, all his septons, all his septas. All his filthy soldiers. Because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good, under the right circumstances.

        <b>LISA:</b> Help me understand, Daisy. Because, I thought you didn’t do Valium. Tell me how this safety net is working for you. Tell me that you don’t take that blade and drag it across your skin and pray for the courage to press down. Tell me… how your daddy helps you cope with that. Illuminate me. I bet… with every inch of his manhood. They didn’t release you because you got better, Daisy. They just gave up. You call this a life, hmm? Taking daddy’s money, buying your dollies and your nick-knacks, eating his fucking chicken, fattening up like a prize fucking heifer. You changed the scenery but not the fucking situation. And the warden makes house calls. And everybody knows. Everybody knows… that he fucks you. But what they don’t know… is that you like it. Hmm? You like it. But hey man, it’s cool. Whatever. A man is a dick is a man is a dick is a chicken, is a dad, a Valium, a speculum, whatever. Whatever. You like being Mrs. Randone. Probably all you’ve ever known, huh?

What do I get ? A daughter who cares as much about a beautiful dress I give her as she cares about me. What's wire hangers doing in this closet?! Answer me!

Out! Out! Out! We're gonna see how many wire hangers you got in your closet! Wire hangers. Why? Why? Christina, get out of that bed! Get out of that bed! You live in the most beautiful house in Brentwood and you dont care about crease marks from wire hangers, and your room looks like some two dollar unfurnished room in some two- bit backstreet town in Oklahoma! Get up! Clean up this mess! Did you scrub the bathroom floor today? Did you?

        <b>O-REN ISHII:</b> As your leader, I encourage you to -- from time to time and always in a respectful manner -- to question my logic. If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so. But allow me to convince you. And I will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo ... except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fucking head. Just like this fucker here. Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!! ... I didn't think so.

        <b>NURSE RACHED:</b> Boys, I’ve given a great deal of thought to what I’m about to say. I’ve talked it over with the staff and we all came to the same conclusion – that there should be some form of punishment for the unspeakable behavior of yesterday. Most of you are here because you could not adjust to the outside world. You broke the rules of society. At some time… in your childhood perhaps… you were allowed to get away with that. But when you broke a rule you knew it. You wanted to be punished – needed it – but the punishment did not come. That leniency on the part of your parents may have been the germ of your present illness. I remind you of this, hoping you will understand that it is entirely for your own good that we enforce discipline. Is there any comment? I assume that you understand me and agree. You also understand that it is difficult to enforce discipline in these surroundings. After all, what can we do you? You can’t be arrested. You can’t be sent to an institution, you’re already there. All we can do is take away privileges.

        <b>ALEX FORREST:</b> Hello, Dan. Are you surprised? This is what you've reduced me to. I guess you thought you'd get away with it. Well... you can't. 'Cause part of you is growing inside of me, and that's a fact, Dan, and... you'd better start... learning how to deal with it. 'Cause you know, I... I feel you. I taste you. I think you. I touch you. Can you understand? Can you? I'm just... asking you... to acknowledge your responsibilities. Is that so bad? I don't think so. I-I don't think it's unreasonable. And, you know, another thing is that you thought that you could just walk into my life, and turn it upside down, without a thought for anyone but yourself. You know what you are, Dan? You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch. I hate you. I bet you don't even like girls, do you? Ha! You disappoint me, you fucking faggot!

    <b>MEDEA:</b> Women, my mind is clear. I go to slay 
My children with all speed, and then, away 
From hence; not wait yet longer till they stand 
Beneath another and an angrier hand 
To die. Yea, howsoe'er I shield them, die 
They must. And, seeing that they must, 'tis I 
Shall slay them, I their mother, touched of none 
Beside. Oh, up and get thine armour on, 
My heart! Why longer tarry we to win 
Our crown of dire inevitable sin? 
Take up thy sword, O poor right hand of mine, 
Thy sword: then onward to the thin-drawn line 
Where life turns agony. Let there be naught 
Of softness now: and keep thee from that thought, 
'Born of thy flesh,' 'thine own belovèd.' Now, 
For one brief day, forget thy children: thou 
Shalt weep hereafter. Though thou slay them, yet 
Sweet were they. . . . I am sore unfort unate.

    <b>AMY DUNNE:</b> Cool girl. Men always use that, don’t they? As their defining compliment. She’s a cool girl. Cool girl is hot. Cool girl is game. Cool girl is fun. Cool girl never gets angry at her man. She only smiles in a chagrin loving manner and then presents her mouth for fucking. She like what he likes. So, evidently, he’s a vinyl hipster who loves fetish monger. If he likes girls gone wild, she’s a mall babe who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.
    When I met Nick Dunne, I knew he wanted a cool girl and for him, I’ll admit, I was willing to try. I wax stripped my pussy raw. I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies. I ate cold pizza and remained a size 2. I blew him… semi regularly. I lived in the moment. I was fucking game. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it… Nick teased out in my things I didn’t know existed. A lightness, a humour, an ease. 
    But I made him smarter, sharper, I inspired him to rise to my level. I forged the man of my dreams. We were happy pretending to be other people. We were the happiest people we knew. And what’s the point of being together if you’re not the happiest. But Nick got lazy. He became someone I did not agree to marry. He actually expected me to love him unco nditionally then he dragged me, penniless, to the naval of this great country and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier cool girl.
    You think I’d let him destroy me and end up happier than ever? No fucking way. He doesn’t get to win. My cute, charming, salt of the earth misery guy. He needed to learn. Grown ups work for things. Grown ups pay. Grown ups suffer consequences.

<div><p class="d"> <b>AILEEN:</b>: I always wanted to be in the movies. When I was little, I thought for sure that one day I was gonna be a big, big star. Or maybe just beautiful. Beautiful and rich. Like the women on TV. Yeah, I had a lot of dreams. And I guess you could call me a real romantic ’cause I truly believed that one day, they’d come true. So I dreamed about it for hours. As the years went by, I learned to stop sharing this with people. They said I was dreaming, but back then, I believed it wholeheartedly. So whenever I was down, I would just escape into my mind, to my other life, where I was someone else. It made me happy to think that all these people just didn’t know yet who I was going to be. But one day, they’d all see. I heard that Marilyn Monroe was discovered in a soda shop and I thought for sure it could be like that. So I started going out real young and I was always secretly looking for who was going to discover me. Was it this guy? Or maybe this one. I never knew. But even if they couldn’t take me all the way, like Marilyn, they would somehow believe in me just enough. They would see me for what I could be and think I was beautiful. Like a diamond in the rough. They would take me away to my new life… and my new world… where everything would be different. Yeah. I lived that way for a long, long time. In my head, dreaming like that. It was nice. And one day, it just stopped.

    <b>HANNAH:</b>I just want someone, who wants to hang out all the time, and thinks I'm the best person in the world, and wants to have sex with only me. And it makes me feel very stupid, to tell you this, because it makes me sound like a girl, who wants to like, 'go to brunch.' And I really don't wanna go to brunch. And I don't want you to, like, sit on the couch while I shop, or, like, even meet my friends. I don't even want that, okay? But I also don't want to share a sex partner with a girl who seems to have asked for a picture of your dick. And also, I don't want a picture of your dick, because I live very near you, so if you wanted me to look at your dick, I could just come over, and look at your dick. And, I don't really see you hearing me. And I don't really see you changing, so. I just summed it up... for you. And, I'm sorry that I didn't figure it out sooner. And you must think I'm even stupider than you thought I was already. But, consider it a testament to your charms, because you might not know this, but you are very, very charming. And I really care about you. And I don't want to anymore, because it feels too shitty for me. So I'm gonna leave...

What band to like. What to buy tickets for. What to joke about. What not to joke about. I want someone to tell me what to believe in. Who to vote for and who to love and how to...tell them. I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father, because so far, I think I’ve been getting it wrong. And I know that’s why people want someone like you in their lives, because you just tell them how to do it. You just tell them what to do and what they’ll get out of the end of it, even though I don’t believe your bullshit and I know that scientifically nothing that I do makes any difference in the end, anyway, I’m still scared. Why am I still scared? So just tell me what to do. Just fucking tell me what to do, Father.

        <b>VILLANELLE:</b>I have real trouble telling the truth. I don’t understand the concept, actually, but… but somebody told me it was important, so… here it goes. Most of the time… Most days… I feel… nothing. I don’t feel anything. It is so boring. I wake up and I think: ‘Again? Really? I have to do this again?’ And what I really don’t understand is how come everybody isn’t screaming with… with boredom too. I… try to find ways of making myself feel something… More and more and more, I… It doesn’t make any difference… No matter what I do, I don’t feel anything, I… I hurt myself, it doesn’t hurt. I buy what I want, I don’t want it. I do what I like, I don’t… I don’t like it. I’m just so bored.
